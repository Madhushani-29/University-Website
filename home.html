                    <p>Loved studying at Eduford before they turned it into a concrete jungle. It used to have an amazing feeling with the trees parks and old school charm and walking through it now days itâ€™s sterile and too much cement not enough not green. </p>

                    <p>My comment is regarding the Library resources of the ANU. Unfortunately compared to other Universities I have found the Library system to be extremely inadequate with a lack of focus on customer service, lack of flexibility, and outdated processes and resources. </p>
